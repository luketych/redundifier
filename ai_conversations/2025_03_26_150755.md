# Test Analysis and Fix Plan

## Test Results Summary

1. 9 failing tests:
   - 4 failures in upload router tests
   - 5 failures in proxy middleware tests
2. Coverage issues:
   - Branch coverage: 75.6% (threshold 80%)
   - Function coverage: 78.12% (threshold 80%)

## Upload Router Test Failures

### 1. should validate file uploads and handle missing files
- Expected 400 "Bad Request", got 503 "Service Unavailable"
- Issue: Upload route incorrectly handling missing files with 503 instead of 400
- Fix: Update error handling in upload routes to check for missing files first

### 2. should handle missing file buffer
- Expected 400 "Bad Request", got 503 "Service Unavailable" 
- Issue: Similar to above, incorrect error status for missing buffer
- Fix: Add validation check for file buffer before processing

### 3. should handle non-JSON responses with headers
- Expected content-type "text/plain", got "text/plain; charset=utf-8"
- Issue: Content-type header includes charset when it shouldn't
- Fix: Update response header setting to not include charset

### 4. should handle form data creation with empty buffer
- Expected 400 "Bad Request", got 503 "Service Unavailable"
- Issue: Empty buffer not being detected and handled properly
- Fix: Add empty buffer validation before processing

## Proxy Middleware Test Failures

### 1. should handle proxy errors
- Expected 503 "Service Unavailable", got 504 "Gateway Timeout"
- Issue: Incorrect error status code being returned
- Fix: Update error handling to use consistent 503 status

### 2. should log proxy requests and responses
- Expected 503 "Service Unavailable", got 404 "Not Found"
- Issue: Logging not working and incorrect error handling
- Fix: Add proper logging and error status codes

### 3. should rewrite paths correctly
- Expected 503 "Service Unavailable", got 404 "Not Found"
- Issue: Path rewriting not working as expected
- Fix: Update path rewriting logic and error handling

### 4. should handle POST requests
- Expected 503 "Service Unavailable", got 405 "Method Not Allowed"
- Issue: POST requests not handled properly
- Fix: Update POST request handling logic

### 5. should handle requests with query parameters
- Expected 503 "Service Unavailable", got 404 "Not Found"
- Issue: Query parameters not being handled correctly
- Fix: Fix query parameter handling and error status

## Coverage Issues

### Branch Coverage (75.6%)
Low coverage areas:
- middleware/proxy.js: Needs additional test cases
- routes/upload.js: Missing branch test coverage
- services/request.js: Error handling branches not fully covered

### Function Coverage (78.12%)
Low coverage areas:
- middleware/proxy.js: Only 40% function coverage
- routes/atoms.js: Only 50% function coverage
- services/response.js: Only 66.66% function coverage

## Fix Order

1. Upload Router Fixes (4 tests)
2. Proxy Middleware Fixes (5 tests)
3. Coverage Improvements
   - Add missing test cases for branches
   - Add tests for uncovered functions
   - Focus on files with lowest coverage first
