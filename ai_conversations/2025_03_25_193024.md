# Intent
- Create dedicated route handler for /api/atoms requests
- Follow same patterns as other routes (health checks, Docker awareness)
- Provide detailed logging for atoms requests

# Changes Made
1. Created new src/routes/atoms.js:
   - Added health check middleware
   - Handles GET requests to /atoms/* paths
   - Includes Docker-aware target URL handling
   - Forwards requests and responses with headers
   - Added error handling and logging

2. Updated server.js:
   - Added atomsRoutes import
   - Mounted /api/atoms route before proxy
   - Added specific logging for atoms route
   - Kept proxy as fallback for other API requests

# Known Considerations
- Uses Docker-aware URL (host.docker.internal) when in Docker environment
- Maintains same health check pattern as other routes
- Forwards all headers and response data
- Uses standard fetch instead of duplicate requests (which are upload-specific)
- Detailed logging will help track atoms request flow
- Route order ensures atoms requests don't hit proxy middleware
