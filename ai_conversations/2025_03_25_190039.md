# Intent
- Fix routing issue preventing /api/atoms and /api/molecules requests from being proxied
- Ensure all non-upload API requests are properly forwarded to the target server

# Changes Made
1. Reordered middleware in server.js:
   - Moved proxy middleware to be registered first
   - Placed upload routes after the proxy middleware
   - Updated comments to clarify the routing logic

# Known Considerations
- Express middleware executes in order of registration
- Moving proxy middleware first ensures all requests get a chance to be proxied
- Upload routes can still override proxy behavior for /api/upload paths
- This maintains special handling for uploads while fixing forwarding of other API requests
