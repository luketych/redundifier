# Intent
- Fix health check functionality to handle redirects and run on every request
- Previous implementation only checked health every minute and failed on redirects
- System was reporting false negatives when target was actually available

# Changes Made
1. Modified health.js:
   - Removed periodic check mechanism (setInterval)
   - Added maxRedirects and followRedirects options to http.request config
   - Simplified HealthService class by removing periodic check logic
2. Updated proxy.js:
   - Modified healthCheckMiddleware to perform health check on every request
   - Maintained existing error handling and status check logic

# Known Considerations
- Health checks now happen on every request which increases overhead but ensures accuracy
- maxRedirects is set to 5 to prevent infinite redirect loops
- System will still mark server as down if redirects exceed maxRedirects limit
