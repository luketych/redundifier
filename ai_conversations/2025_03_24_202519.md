# Intent
- Fix health check reliability issues caused by http.request
- Replace with modern fetch API for better control and consistency
- Maintain same timeout and redirect handling capabilities

# Changes Made
1. Completely rewrote health check implementation:
   - Removed http.request in favor of fetch API
   - Added proper timeout handling using AbortController
   - Simplified redirect handling using fetch's built-in 'follow' option
   - Added async/await for cleaner promise handling
   - Added better error logging for timeouts vs other failures

# Known Considerations
- checkHealth is now an async function, though this doesn't affect usage since it was already running asynchronously
- Using same fetch API as request.js for consistency across the codebase
- Timeout is still set to 2 seconds
- Removed redundant event handlers that were causing multiple state updates
