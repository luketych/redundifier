# Health Check Removal

## Intent and Purpose
- Remove all health check functionality from the application
- Simplify the codebase by removing unnecessary monitoring code
- Remove outdated/unused health checking mechanisms

## Changes Made
- Removed `/health` endpoint from server.js
- Removed health check from proxy middleware chain 
- Removed health check implementation and imports from proxy.js
- Removed health check middleware and imports from index.js
- Removed health check middleware and imports from api.js
- Removed unused health service import from upload.js
- Deleted health.js service file

## Known Issues/Considerations
- System will no longer actively monitor target server health
- Error responses (503) will still be sent on connection failures but without health check context
- Removed health checks might need to be replaced with a more robust monitoring solution if needed in the future
