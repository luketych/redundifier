# Intent
- Add comprehensive logging to track request flow
- Debug proxy and routing issues with more visibility
- Make it clear which middleware is handling each request

# Changes Made
1. Enhanced server.js logging:
   - Added global request logging middleware
   - Added specific logging for upload route handling
   - Added specific logging for proxy handling
   - Made middleware chain more explicit

2. Enhanced proxy.js logging:
   - Added initialization log showing target configuration
   - Added detailed request logging showing path and method
   - Added response logging with status codes
   - Prefixed all logs with [PROXY], [SERVER], or [UPLOAD] for clarity

# Known Considerations
- Logs will now show:
  * Initial request receipt at server level
  * Which handler (upload or proxy) processes the request
  * Proxy forwarding details including target URL
  * Response status from target server
- Debug level logging from http-proxy-middleware is still enabled
- All stages of request processing are now traceable
