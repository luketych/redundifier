# Intent
- Implement consistent health check handling for upload endpoint
- Match behavior of other endpoints that use proxy middleware
- Fix typo in middleware name

# Changes Made
1. Added proper health check middleware to upload.js:
   - Replaced placeholder 'moddleware' with actual health check implementation
   - Added TARGET import from config for error messages
   - Uses same health check pattern as proxy middleware:
     * Checks health before processing request
     * Returns 503 if target is unreachable
     * Includes last check timestamp in error response

# Known Considerations
- Upload endpoint now has same health check behavior as other endpoints
- Maintains existing error handling in request processing
- Both pre-request health checks and error-triggered health checks are in place
- Error responses follow same format as proxy middleware for consistency
