# Intent
- Fix routing to handle both upload and non-upload API requests correctly
- Preserve upload endpoint functionality while enabling other API routes

# Changes Made
1. Restored upload routes to first position to maintain its functionality
2. Modified proxy middleware mount point:
   - Changed from '/' to '/api' to be more specific
   - This ensures proxy only handles API requests
   - Excludes /api/upload which is handled by its own route
   - Includes /api/atoms, /api/molecules, and other API endpoints

# Known Considerations
- Upload routes take precedence for /api/upload paths
- All other /api/* requests are handled by the proxy
- More specific routing prevents interference between upload and proxy handlers
- Order of middleware registration is crucial for proper request handling
