do# Intent
- Fix container build issue with npm ci command
- Generate package-lock.json file required for clean installs

# Changes Made
1. Ran npm install to generate package-lock.json file
   - This file is required for npm ci command which is used in container builds
   - npm ci provides more reliable and reproducible builds by using exact versions

# Known Considerations
- package-lock.json should be committed to version control
- npm ci will fail if package-lock.json is missing or out of sync with package.json
