# Intent
- Update health check service to also use Docker-aware host resolution
- Maintain consistency with request.js Docker URL handling

# Changes Made
1. Updated src/services/health.js:
   - Added IS_DOCKER_INTERNAL import from server config
   - Added conditional URL generation in checkHealth method
   - Uses host.docker.internal:1337 when IS_DOCKER_INTERNAL is true
   - Maintains existing TARGET usage for non-Docker environments

# Known Considerations
- Both health checks and requests now consistently use the same host resolution logic
- Health check still maintains its redirect handling capabilities with maxRedirects option
