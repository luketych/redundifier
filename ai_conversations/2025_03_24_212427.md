# Intent
- Add automatic npm package installation when running docker-compose up
- Ensure dependencies are installed before starting the development server

# Changes Made
1. Updated docker-compose.yml:
   - Added command override to run multiple commands in sequence
   - First runs npm install to ensure all dependencies are up to date
   - Then runs npm run dev to start the development server
   - Uses sh -c to run multiple commands in a single shell

# Known Considerations
- Dependencies will be installed every time the container starts
- Node modules are still persisted in a Docker volume
- Development mode is maintained with hot reloading
- Command is run after the container is built and environment variables are set
