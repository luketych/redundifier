# Conversation: Setting up VSCode Dev Containers

## Intent
- Configure the project to run in VSCode Dev Containers for consistent development environment
- Enable easy onboarding for new developers
- Ensure proper isolation of development dependencies

## Changes Made
- Created Dockerfile for Node.js environment setup
- Created docker-compose.yml for service configuration
- Set up .devcontainer configuration with:
  - devcontainer.json for VSCode settings and extensions
  - docker-compose.yml for development-specific overrides
- Configured proper volume mounts for source code and node_modules
- Set up port forwarding for the application (3000)
- Added development-focused VSCode extensions

## Notes & Considerations
- Port 3000 is used instead of 1337 (which was in the example) since this is a different type of service
- No database service was needed since this is a proxy service
- Node.js extensions and settings are configured for optimal development experience
- Hot reloading is enabled through nodemon in development mode
