# Intent
- Enable Docker container to communicate with target server using host.docker.internal
- Add configuration flag to switch between local and Docker host resolution
- Maintain existing functionality for non-Docker environments

# Changes Made
1. Added IS_FORWARDED_SERVER_ON_SAME_DOCKER environment variable:
   - Added to docker-compose.yml with value 1
   - When enabled, uses host.docker.internal instead of localhost

2. Modified src/config/server.js:
   - Added IS_DOCKER_INTERNAL config flag
   - Reads from IS_FORWARDED_SERVER_ON_SAME_DOCKER environment variable

3. Updated src/services/request.js:
   - Added conditional URL generation in sendDuplicateRequests
   - Uses host.docker.internal:1337 when IS_DOCKER_INTERNAL is true
   - Maintains existing TARGET usage for non-Docker environments

# Known Considerations
- host.docker.internal resolution is already configured in docker-compose.yml with extra_hosts
- Target port (1337) is hardcoded in Docker URL for clarity, could be made configurable if needed
- Environment variable follows 0/1 boolean pattern for consistency with common Docker practices
