# Intent
- Fix proxy Gateway Timeout issues in Docker environment
- Make proxy target URL Docker-aware like request service
- Add better debug logging for proxy requests

# Changes Made
1. Made proxy target URL Docker-aware:
   - Added IS_DOCKER_INTERNAL import from config
   - Uses host.docker.internal:1337 when running in Docker
   - Maintains localhost:1337 for non-Docker environments

2. Improved proxy debugging:
   - Added logLevel: 'debug' to proxy options
   - Updated request logging to show correct target URL
   - Shows Docker-aware URL in logs when IS_DOCKER_INTERNAL is true

# Known Considerations
- Proxy now matches request service behavior for Docker environments
- Both use host.docker.internal when IS_FORWARDED_SERVER_ON_SAME_DOCKER is set
- Debug logging will help track request forwarding issues
- Health check still uses TARGET for error messages as that's the configured value
