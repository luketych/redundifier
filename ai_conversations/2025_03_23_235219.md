# Conversation: Node.js Proxy Server Implementation

## Intent
- Create a proxy server that intercepts specific upload requests while forwarding all other traffic
- Provide a way to handle file uploads separately from the main application
- Enable future enhancement for file duplication functionality

## Testing Setup
- Added Jest and Supertest for testing
- Created test suite in tests/server.test.js:
  - Tests for upload endpoint interception
  - Tests for proxy forwarding behavior
  - Mock target server for integration tests
- Test scripts available:
  - `npm test`: Run all tests
  - `npm run test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
  - `npm run test:coverage`: Run tests with coverage report
  - `npm run test:debug`: Run tests in debug mode
- VSCode launch configuration added for debugging tests

## Implementation
- Created a Node.js/Express server that:
  - Listens on port 1336
  - Uses http-proxy-middleware to forward requests to port 1337
  - Intercepts POST requests to /api/upload/* paths
  - Currently returns a mock response for upload endpoints
  - Forwards all other requests unchanged
- Added comprehensive NPM scripts:
  - `start`: Basic server start
  - `dev`: Development mode with auto-reload (nodemon)
  - `debug`: Debug mode with inspector
  - `prod`: Production mode
  - `lint`: Code linting
- Added VSCode launch configurations:
  - Launch Development: Runs server with nodemon
  - Launch Production: Runs in production mode
  - Debug Server: Runs with Node inspector
  - Full Debug compound configuration

## Development Setup
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run in development: `npm run dev`
- Run in production: `npm run prod`
- Debug mode: `npm run debug`
- Lint code: `npm run lint`

## Known Considerations
- Mock response currently implemented for upload endpoint - real file handling needs to be implemented
- Assumes target server (port 1337) is running and accessible
- No error handling for cases where target server is down
- No request body parsing middleware added yet - would be needed for handling actual file uploads
- Basic implementation with no security measures or rate limiting
