# Conversation History

## Task
Add health check mechanism for proxy server to monitor target server status and handle failures gracefully.

## Changes Made

### Intent
A) Improve reliability and user experience by:
   - Ensuring target server is available before proxying requests
   - Providing immediate feedback when target server is down
   - Maintaining continuous monitoring of target server health

B) Implementation Details:
   1. Created new HealthService (src/services/health.js):
      - Performs periodic health checks every 60 seconds
      - Maintains current server status
      - Provides status check method for proxy middleware

   2. Enhanced proxy middleware (src/middleware/proxy.js):
      - Added separate health check middleware that runs before proxy
      - Returns 503 with detailed message when server is down
      - Triggers health check on proxy errors
      - Includes last check timestamp in error responses
      - Exports array of [healthCheckMiddleware, proxyMiddleware]

   3. Enhanced upload route (src/routes/upload.js):
      - Added health check middleware to protect upload endpoints
      - Returns same 503 response format when server is down
      - Triggers health check on upload request errors
      - Maintains existing duplicate request functionality

   4. Updated server.js to properly handle middleware chain:
      - Changed app.use('/', proxyMiddleware) to app.use('/', ...proxyMiddleware)
      - Ensures health check runs before proxy attempt

C) Known Considerations:
   - Health check uses a 2-second timeout which may need adjustment based on network conditions
   - Simple health check only checks server response, not specific endpoint health
   - Health status is stored in memory, will reset if proxy server restarts
   - Initial implementation used onProxyReq incorrectly, fixed by using separate middleware
   - Health check is shared between proxy and upload routes, ensuring consistent behavior
