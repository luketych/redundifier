# Intent
- Fix proxy forwarding for /api/atoms and similar endpoints
- Properly handle /api prefix when forwarding requests to target server

# Changes Made
1. Added pathRewrite configuration to proxy options:
   ```javascript
   pathRewrite: {
       '^/api': '', // remove /api prefix when forwarding
   }
   ```
   - This strips the /api prefix before forwarding
   - Makes localhost:1336/api/atoms forward to TARGET/atoms
   - Similarly /api/molecules forwards to TARGET/molecules

# Known Considerations
- Requests are now properly forwarded without the /api prefix
- Upload endpoint still works as it's handled before proxy middleware
- Target server expects paths without /api prefix
- Original proxy error was due to incorrect path forwarding (/api/atoms trying to reach /api/api/atoms)
