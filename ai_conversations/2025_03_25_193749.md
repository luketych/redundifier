# Intent
- Restructure routes with proper separation of concerns
- Move router creation and health check to a central location
- Keep route handlers focused on their specific functionality

# Changes Made
1. Created src/routes/index.js:
   - Central router creation
   - Health check middleware applied to all routes
   - Mount points for upload and atoms routes
   - Single source for route configuration

2. Simplified upload.js and atoms.js:
   - Removed duplicate health check code
   - Focused purely on handling their specific routes
   - Maintained existing functionality
   - Upload keeps raw body parsing and duplicate requests
   - Atoms keeps standard request forwarding

3. Updated server.js:
   - Uses new centralized router from routes/index.js
   - Removed api.js in favor of proper route organization
   - Proxy middleware now handles all non-matched requests

# Known Considerations
- Health check is now applied consistently across all routes
- Route handlers are more focused and maintainable
- Clear separation between router setup and route handling
- Follows Express.js best practices for route organization
- Better code reuse with centralized middleware
