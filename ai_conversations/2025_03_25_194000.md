# Intent
- Fix path handling to correctly forward requests to target server
- Ensure /api prefixes are stripped before forwarding
- Add better logging to track request paths

# Changes Made
1. Fixed atoms.js path handling:
   - Added healthService import
   - Strip /api/atoms prefix from originalUrl
   - Forward clean path to target server

2. Fixed request.js path handling:
   - Strip /api/upload prefix from incoming paths
   - Added logging to show original and cleaned paths
   - Forward clean path to target server

# Known Considerations
- All routes now properly strip their /api prefixes:
  * /api/upload/xyz -> forwards to /xyz
  * /api/atoms/xyz -> forwards to /xyz
- Added debug logging to help track path transformations
- Maintains Docker-aware URL handling with clean paths
- Both upload and atoms routes should now forward correctly to target server
