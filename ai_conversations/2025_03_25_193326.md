# Intent
- Consolidate route handling into a single unified API router
- Remove duplicate router instances and code
- Maintain same functionality with cleaner organization

# Changes Made
1. Created new src/routes/api.js:
   - Combined upload and atoms route handlers
   - Single shared health check middleware
   - Consistent error handling and logging
   - Maintained existing functionality:
     * Upload with duplicate requests
     * Atoms with standard forwarding
     * Docker-aware URL handling
     * Health checks and error responses

2. Updated server.js:
   - Removed separate route mounting for upload and atoms
   - Added single mount point for all API routes: /api
   - Kept proxy as fallback for unhandled requests
   - Simplified middleware chain

# Known Considerations
- Routes are now matched in order within api.js
- Both upload and atoms paths maintain their specific handling
- Upload still uses duplicate requests while atoms uses standard forwarding
- Single health check middleware shared across all routes
- Express route precedence ensures correct handler selection
- More maintainable with shared code in one place
